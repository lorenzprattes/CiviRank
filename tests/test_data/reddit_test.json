Mainstream brands are also welcome obviously, but my goal for this year to try out more indie goodies. \n\nThank you in advance guys :)",

            "text": "I guess I’m writing here, because I have no one to confide in who would understand what I’m going through.\n\nSo I started learning to code a good three years ago, and I still consider myself very much a junior at this. I come from a linguistic background, so it was all quite new to me. I got my first coding job a year and a half ago. It’s an awesome team with an amazing boss and I get a lot of support here. I consider myself very lucky to be working in such an environment. First few months I was doing minor changes and simple bug fixes, then I spent almost a year writing tests (learning jest, cypress, jmeter). I wasn’t really doing any real coding during that time, neither did I have the energy to do any of my own projects.\n\nIn the beginning of the year my boss came to me and another junior dev with a project. To expand an existing part of a web app for a client. Of course I was excited to do some real coding, finally. We had about two months and a half to do it, but the project was supposed to be simple (so said my boss), but I got really lost in the code for a while. Took me about three weeks before I got a decent grasp on where things were and what they did, and the work went on slowly. Frustratingly slowly for me. I spent so much time being unsure of myself. I thought of four possible ways to do something but couldn’t decide which one to go with. I still struggle with this. We did get help from two senior devs on our team, but they also had their own work to do and their own deadlines.\n\nOne of the major issues for me was that the data we got from the client was from the old implementation and didn’t display properly when we started changing how things worked. We kept reminding them to give us real data, and that went on for two months. No real data. \nThen three weeks ago the client told us an importer had to be built to import the data (that they still didn’t have at this point, but they at least had a template of what the data would look like). They would provide an excel file with the data to import into the database. This was not originally part of the plan, but we decided to do this as well. I spent 10 days writing the code for the importer (painfully slow and I didn’t even manage to finish it). It was not a straightforward: one tab is one table in the database. Everything was jumbled up, there were formulas that needed to be written out separately. It was just a big mess. \n\nThen they sent us the real data 2 days before the deadline and still expected it to be finished on time. There’s so many things still not done and I’m so behind on my tasks because I spent so much time with this importer, that several developers had to be added to the project in the last two days to finish everything on time. I haven’t been sleeping well for the past week from all the stress and guilt I feel for messing up. My brain feels like complete mush.\n\nHow do you go through moments like these? Because as I’m learning, this is something normal. Client wants something fast, they don’t provide you what you need, but you still have to deliver on time? I mean, I’ve dealt with stress before, but then I at least knew what i was doing. I still feel like I know sh\\t about coding and I feel like I let everyone in my team down, because now they have to work to fix my mistakes.\n\nEDIT: I want to thank everyone that chimed in with your opinions and experience. I realize now that I was too hard on myself and that I shouldn’t take on all of the responsibility. After this is over and done, I’ll regroup, look at what I did wrong, think on what I could have done differently and learn from my mistakes. Thank you all again for taking the time to respond.",

            "text": "Hi everyone!\n\nI was recently diagnosed with major depressive disorder with recurrent episodes and also diagnosed with psychoses. My psychiatrist says it looks a lot like a schizoaffective disorder but she is not 100% sure because even if all the diagnostic criteria are met she told me she doesn’t feel that I have a schizoaffective disorder.\n\nSo for now I’m still wondering what I have exactly, the only thing I know is that I have psychoses and major depressive disorder (and a lot of social anxiety lol).\n\nI’ve been struggling with all this stuff for more than 5 years and was admitted to a mental hospital a few months ago because the depression and the psychotic symptoms were really getting out of hand. I’ve been seeing a psychiatrist for about 2 years but we really started to treat my psychotic symptoms only when I was admitted to the hospital. I’m currently still there but now I’m doing very well so I’ll be out soon.\n\nDuring my depressive episodes I tended to have very scary/mean hallucinations and delusions, but outside my depressive episodes I had a few good experiences with some voices being very kind to me, sometimes I kind of miss them lol. But I prefer not having any hallucinations at all than having the good and the bad ones.\n\nNow with medication I don’t have any hallucinations anymore but I still have some strange beliefs sometimes. For now the side effects are annoying but not too much so I think I can deal with them, but I hope someday we can reduce medication (I take aripiprazole, loxapine, fluoxetine, and lithium).\n\nI hope you’ll have a great day and wish you the best!\n\n\nEDIT: My psychiatrist actually updated my diagnosis. I have a schizoaffective disorder.",

Make sure you've read my existing [performance guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cyLaDiPL_B6nOZw_qPE_wOGuoeRT-qddTjevTFoFBkg/view) if you haven't already. I wanted to have exceptional BDO performance, more than anyone. So I kept secrets from all of you. But today my hardware is so good that I can have amazing performance even if the rest of you plebs have my secrets, so on this momentous day I have decided to share them with you all.\n\nI'll be making sure to tag these all with spoilers just in case, some of these tweaks are not for the light hearted.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. >!Make sure you set your CPU affinity to only allow Black Desert to use 1 core. We all know that games don't use lots of threads super well, and prefer to have a higher core frequency. Not only will your processor boost to its highest frequency and be able to spend its entire power budget (TDP) on Black Desert when the load is on only one core, but all those other cores will be open to background tasks meaning that Black Desert will never be interrupted by background tasks!!<\n2. >!Cap your game FPS to 30 in your graphics card's drivers. In the \"Impact of Framerate\" video on my YouTube channel, I noted that 30 FPS has some sort of mild speedhack applied to make the game speed catch up to the speed of higher framerates. This means you can get the best game speed while barely sipping power, saving money! Key input registration happens per frame to make cancels easier? Pfft. Who cares? Your skill animations are fast as f\\*\\*\\*, boi!!<\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope that with these exceptional tweaks to your systems, you'll be able to have exceptional BDO performance just like me.",

I built it and had limited testing before leaving home. Now I’m at a local game store playing it but I find it not fun at all. I instantly become the enemy and after my initial early turn 1-2 cast of Slicer I find it hard to keep up after it turns into a 3v1 and struggle to keep Slicer on the battlefield. \n\nI was wondering if you all have any suggestions of another commander that I can turn this deck into while keeping 70-80% of the deck intact. It has lots of ritual, equipment, spell re-direction, instant speed damage boost, no stax pieces. \n\nThanks for the help!!\n\nDecklist:\nhttps://www.moxfield.com/decks/Pvnsj-qlWkSIYOst5uQzfA",
